rust-bloom-filter
=================

Bloom filter library implemented in Rust -- includes MurmurHash3
implementation, and simple bit vector library


Still very early implementation. Currently includes working 32-bit
murmurhash3 implementation, as well as a working bit vector library
that can `set`, `unset`, `flip` bits.
