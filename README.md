rust-bloom-filter
=================

Bloom filter library implemented in Rust -- includes Murmur Hash 3 implementation 


Still very early implementation. Murmur.rs is setup as a stand alone application currently
for testing and debugging purposes. Proper module and whatnot soon to follow. After murmur
hash module is cleaned up a bloom filter implementation will be soon to follow.
